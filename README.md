    - [Visual Studio 2019](https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?q=visual%20studio%202019)
    - Select the "Community - Free Download" option to obtain the installer app.
    - Open the installer app and follow these steps:
        - Navigate to the "Workloads" section and install both "Desktop development with C++" and "Game development with C++."
        - In the "Individual components" section, install "C++ Clang-cl for v142 build tools (x64/x86)."
    - Click "Install while downloading" and wait for the process to complete.

3. **Download and extract the OpenDBO-Core Repository:**
    - [OpenDBO-Core Repository](https://github.com/OpenDBO/OpenDBO-Core). Click "Code" -> Download ZIP.
    - Extract the ZIP file to the main folder named "OpenDBO-Core."

4. **Download and install/extract additional programs: it's recommended to set up the Client repository now. Otherwise perform steps 1 and 2 from the Client guide (if you already did it you can skip this step)**

5. **Compile the private server using Visual Studio 2019:**
    - Navigate to the "OpenDBO-Core" main folder, then to the "Dboserver" subfolder.
    - Double-click "Dboserver.sln" to open it in Visual Studio 2019.
    - Ensure "Release" and "x64" are selected from the top bar.
    - In the "Solution Explorer," under "Server," right-click each server (AuthServer, CharServer, etc.) and click "Build" one by one.
    - Wait for the server executable files to finish compiling.

6. **Download and install XAMPP (you can also install the latest version of MariaDB directly, if so, you can skip this step and some steps of 7.):**
    - Deactivate User Account Control (UAC) by searching for "msconfig" in Windows, accessing the "tools" tab, and selecting "Disable UAC."
    - Download and install XAMPP from [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
    - Navigate to "C:/xampp/apache/conf/httpd.conf" in Explorer.
    - Open "httpd.conf" in Notepad, change the port to "Listen 8080," and change "ServerName localhost:" to "ServerName localhost:8080."
    - In the XAMPP Control Panel, start "Apache" and "MySQL."
    - Ensure your antivirus accepts XAMPP.
    - If you've set a password for the configuration files on your server, you might not be able to connect to XAMPP without following these steps:
    - open terminal in xampp control panel
    - Run the following command to set a password (in this example, the password is 123, but you can use any password):
    - mysqladmin.exe -u root password 123
    - Press Enter.
    - Go to the phpMyAdmin folder and open the config.inc file.
    - Find the password option and enter the password 123 (or the password you chose) inside the quotes.
    - This will prevent any connection conflicts.

7. **Open your browser and type: "localhost:8080/phpmyadmin/"**
    - Click "New" in the left column.
    - Add a database named "dbo_acc" and click "make."
    - Click "import" at the top, choose file, and select "dbo_acc.sql" from "OpenDBO-Core/DboServer/Database."
    - Click "Start" at the bottom.
    - Repeat this for "dbo_char" and "dbo_log."
    - Within "dbo_acc," find "accounts," click "insert," and fill in a username and password.
    - Generate an MD5 Hash for the password using [MD5 Hash Generator](https://www.md5hashgenerator.com), paste it next to "Password_hash," and click "Start" at the bottom.
    - If you want GM permissions make sure to set `admin` and `isgm` to `10` in the `accounts` table and `gamemaster` to `10` in the `characters` tabel from the `dbo_char` database.

8. **Change the server .ini files:**
    - Navigate to "OpenDBO-Core/DboServer/ExecutionEnv/Config."
    - Open "AuthServer.ini," "CharServer.ini," etc., with Notepad.
    - Ensure all IP addresses are "127.0.0.1" and change the password to "test."

9. **Run the server executables:**
    - Go to "OpenDBO-Core/DboServer/ExecutionEnv."
    - Run `start_master_server.bat`
    - Run `start_query_server.bat` and wait until its done (if you get missing `MSVCP120.dll` error you can fix it by installing Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2013).
    - Run `start_char_server_0.bat`
    - Run `start_auth_server.bat`
    - Run `start_channel_0.bat` and wait until it's finished (can take a lot of time, might need to press ENTER). Then close it.
    - Run `start_chat_server.bat` and wait until its done.
    - Run `start_channel_0.bat` again, `start_channel_1.bat` (if you need 2 channels) and `start_channel_9.bat`

10. **Download and extract the DBO Client Files:**
    - Development Client/Server Access
    - In the main folder, locate "ConfigOptions.xml," change the IP to "127.0.0.1" on each line, and save.
